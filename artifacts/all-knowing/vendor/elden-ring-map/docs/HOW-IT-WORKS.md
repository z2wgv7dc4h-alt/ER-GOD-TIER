# How it works

Notes on the reverse engineering behind this project: how the save file is
decoded, how the map tiles come out of the game archives, and how world
coordinates become map pixels.

None of this is needed to use the map — see the [README](../README.md) for that.

---

## Reading the save

`ER0000.sl2` is a BND4 container of 12 entries: ten character slots plus a
profile summary and a regulation copy. Each entry is `[16-byte MD5][payload]`.

Elden Ring PC saves are **not encrypted** — the MD5 verifies directly against the
raw bytes. (An AES path exists in `server/lib/bnd4.js` as a fallback, but it is
never needed for a stock save.) That MD5 is doubly useful: it is a cheap change
detector, and because the file is *always* exactly 28,967,888 bytes, it is the
only reliable way to tell a finished write from one caught in progress.

A slot is a sequentially-serialised struct with five variable-length members, so
**nothing in it sits at a fixed offset**. We measured the event-flag bitfield move
by 2,216 bytes between two saves taken minutes apart. `server/lib/slotWalk.js`
walks every field in order, asserting the values the format guarantees — a
`FACE` magic, booleans that must be 0/1, a 0/8 enum, and a zero byte immediately
after the bitfield — so a mis-step fails loudly instead of returning plausible
garbage.

## Which character is shown

The game does not record which slot was played last, and a character that has
never saved has a zeroed position block until its first autosave. So the map
shows the slot picked in the sidebar (remembered per save file in
`data/user-state.json`), else the first occupied one. With the live reader
running, the running character is the slot whose last saved position is nearest
the live map-screen pixel on the same map, with two guards: the slot on screen
keeps its place unless another is nearer by more than 8 px, and a reading more
than 1,024 px (four tiles) from every saved position decides nothing. Three
consecutive samples have to agree before the display switches.

## Event flags

Progress lives in a 1,833,375-byte (`0x1BF99F`) bitfield. Flag lookup:

```
block  = flagId / 1000
index  = flagId % 1000
byte   = base + BLOCK_TABLE[block] * 125 + index / 8
bit    = 7 - (index % 8)                        // MSB-first
```

`BLOCK_TABLE` is `data/eventflag_bst.txt` (11,919 entries), from
[ER-Save-Lib](https://github.com/ClayAmore/ER-Save-Lib). 125 bytes = exactly
1000 flags per block.

## Coordinates

The projection from world space to map pixels is exact — 1 pixel = 1 world unit,
no rotation:

```
S      = 256                            world units per overworld grid cell
worldX = gridX*S + S/2 + posX           each cell's centre is its local origin
worldZ = gridZ*S + S/2 + posZ
px     = worldX - 7168
py     = 16640 - worldZ
```

Legacy dungeons have their own local frames and are translated onto the overworld
via `WorldMapLegacyConvParam`. Some of its rows hop dungeon→dungeon
(`m13_00_00 → m34_15_00 → m60_51_46`), so resolution follows chains.

A dungeon that straddles several overworld cells gets one row per cell, and for
95 of the 98 blocks those rows all describe the same world point in a different
cell-local frame — they agree to within 36 px, so the choice really is
arbitrary. Three blocks are not like that. Crumbling Farum Azula's rows disagree
by 3673 px, the Finger Birthing Grounds' by 912, the Haligtree's by 661, because
those regions are drawn on the map nowhere near where they connect to the
overworld — Farum Azula is a floating island out east, but it is entered from
the Forge of the Giants in the Mountaintops, and there is a row for each. So the
row is chosen once per block rather than per position, which is what keeps a
region in one piece: the game's own `isBasePoint` first, then whichever row
spells an anchor out instead of leaving it at the origin.

Sanity check: "The First Step" lands at px 3699, matching independently published
values to within a pixel.

## Map tiles

`menu/71_maptile.tpfbhd` indexes 28,469 tile textures. Each filename ends in a
variant bitmask — which map fragments the player holds, plus world-event bits.
To render a fully-revealed vanilla map you must pick, per cell, the variant
matching that cell's entry in `71_maptile.mtmskbnd`, indexed as
`lod*10000 + col*100 + row`.

Heuristics do **not** work here: "most bits set" disagrees with the real mask on
247 of 1369 cells, and the wrong pick swaps in art for a different world state,
producing a visible patchwork. With the mask table the match is 1369/1369.

Pipeline per tile: `Data0.bdt → 71_maptile.tpfbdt → DCX/Oodle → TPF → DDS(BC7)
→ RGBA → stitch → pyramid`. Oodle decompression calls the game's own
`oo2core_6_win64.dll`; BC7 decoding uses `texture2ddecoder`.
